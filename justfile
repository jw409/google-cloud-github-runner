# Recipes for the meshly.ai soft fork of google-cloud-github-runner.
#
# This file is OURS — a fork addition, not a vendor path. It must never appear
# in a pull request to upstream, which has its own conventions and did not ask
# for a task runner.
#
# Everything here is read-only or local. Nothing deploys, nothing applies
# infrastructure, and nothing writes to a meshly repository — the last one is
# also enforced by .claude/hooks/no-meshly-writes.sh, because an instruction
# that only lives in a comment is an instruction with no gate.

# Detected rather than hardcoded. `python` is not on PATH on every machine --
# it is not on this one -- and a recipe that works only in the author's shell
# is a recipe that fails for the next person with exit 127 and no explanation.
PY := `command -v python3 || command -v python || echo python3`

# the global environment; without uv the script itself exits 2 and says how to
# install it, rather than failing with an ImportError traceback.

# Prefer an interpreter that ALREADY has pytest -- upstream's
# requirements-dev.txt installs it, so a contributor who followed the project's
# own setup has it on `python`. Only fall back to uv when it is absent, so this
# does not force a tool upstream never asked for onto someone who is set up
# correctly. Detected by importing it, not by guessing from the path.

# The directory is passed EXPLICITLY and that is not redundant: `testpaths` is
# resolved against pytest's inferred rootdir, which differs between a bare run
# and one with arguments. A bare run resolves it to the PROJECT's suite, which
# needs Flask installed and fails collection — an environment failure that
# looks like a fork failure. A proof command that only works when invoked one
# particular way is not a proof command.

# Run the IP allowlist test suite (the proof command).

# --- handoff ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sanitize AGENTS-LOCAL-USER.md and print a prompt for a MESHLY agent.
#
# This session cannot write to meshly repositories, so meshly-side work leaves
# here as a prompt that a meshly agent executes in its own repo, under its own
# hooks and gates. Copy the output into that session.
#
# The operator's personal details (a personal domain, a residential IP and its
# reverse DNS) are redacted; meshly's own repo and org names are NOT, because
# the destination is a private repo and stripping them would make the handoff
# useless. Secrets are refused outright rather than redacted. The redaction is
# verified against the OUTPUT, so a pattern that failed to substitute refuses
# instead of leaking.

# Print a sanitized handoff prompt for a MESHLY agent to run in its own repo.
